# ❯ Intro

Udacity Advanced Full Stack Program (image processing) project.

## ❯ Overview

Building an API that can be used in two different ways.
As a simple placeholder API, the first allows you to place images into your frontend with the size set via URL parameters (and additional stylization if you choose) for rapid prototyping.
The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of your images to the front end to reduce page load size.

Try it!! We are happy to hear your feedback or any kind of new features.
